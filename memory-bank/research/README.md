## 1. Purpose  

The **research** folder captures deep-dive investigations, design spikes, competitive analyses, and API explorations that inform the Analyst Augmentation Agent roadmap.  
This `README.md` offers:

1. A categorized list of **current research papers** with one-line summaries.  
2. A **template & guidelines** for adding new research documents so knowledge stays structured and discoverable.

## 3. Contributing New Research  

### 3.1 File Naming Convention
```
yyyy-mm-dd-key-topic.md
```
*Examples:*  
`2025-07-02-open-telemetry-evaluation.md`  
`2025-07-15-llm-context-window-benchmarks.md`

### 3.2 Front-Matter Header (optional)
```yaml
title: OpenTelemetry Evaluation
author: Jane Doe
date: 2025-07-02
category: Observability & DevOps
status: draft   # draft | reviewed | adopted
```

### 3.3 Recommended Document Outline
1. **Problem / Question** â€“ What are we trying to learn or decide?  
2. **Background** â€“ Existing knowledge or constraints.  
3. **Investigation & Findings** â€“ Experiments, data, diagrams, pros/cons.  
4. **Recommendation** â€“ Clear suggestion or next step.  
5. **Appendix** â€“ Raw data, links, references.

### 3.4 Review Workflow
1. Commit the new markdown file under `memory-bank/research/`.  
2. Update the table in Section 2 with a one-line summary.  
3. Open a pull request and request review from the **Domain Lead** (see `MASTER_STATUS.md`).  
4. Once merged, update `status:` front-matter from `draft` â†’ `reviewed` or `adopted`.

## 4. House-Keeping Rules  

* Keep research documents **short & focused** â€” big reports can be split.  
* When conclusions drive code changes, reference the research doc in the PR description.  
* Outdated docs can be moved to `/archive` subfolder to declutter the index.
