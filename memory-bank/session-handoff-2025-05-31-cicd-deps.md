# Session Handoff â€“ 31 May 2025 (CI/CD & Dependency Management)

**Session Window:** 31 May 2025 (approx. 23:30 UTC onwards)
**Lead:** illiterate ai (Factory Droid)
**Primary Repositories:**
*   GitHub: `illiterateailabs/analyst-agent-illiterateai` (updated)
*   GitLab: `illiterateailabs/analyst-agent-illiterateai-gitlabs` (requires manual sync)

---

## 1. Session Context & Main Issues Addressed

This session focused on resolving critical GitLab CI pipeline failures and preparing for a systematic update of outdated project dependencies.

**Main Issues:**
*   **GitLab CI Timeouts**: The `lint` job was consistently timing out after 1 hour due to `pip` dependency resolution backtracking.
*   **GitLab CI Configuration Error**: The `test` job's `neo4j` service definition included an invalid `ports` key.
*   **Outdated Google SDK**: The project was using the older `google-generativeai` package instead of the recommended `google-genai`.
*   **Numerous Outdated Dependencies**: A significant number of packages in `requirements.txt` were outdated, posing potential security and compatibility risks.

---

## 2. What Was Fixed & Implemented

### A. GitLab CI/CD Pipeline
*   **Dependency Resolution Fix**:
    *   Updated `constraints.txt` with specific versions for problematic packages (`grpcio`, `grpcio-status`, `langchain-core`, `langchain-community`, `huggingface-hub`, `googleapis-common-protos`, `protobuf`) to prevent `pip` backtracking.
*   **Configuration Correction**:
    *   Removed the invalid `ports` key from the `neo4j` service definition in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
*   **Optimizations**:
    *   Added a `timeout: 30m` to the `lint` job in `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
    *   Improved the CI cache key in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to include `requirements.txt` and `constraints.txt` for better invalidation.
    *   Modified the `test` job in `.gitlab-ci.yml` to install dependencies once per Python version using `before_script`.
*   **Documentation**:
    *   Created `CI_DEPENDENCY_FIX.md` detailing the CI issues and solutions.

### B. Google SDK Migration
*   Updated `requirements.txt` to use `google-genai>=0.2.0` (replacing `google-generativeai`).
*   Updated `scripts/test_gemini_models.py` to import from the new `google-genai` SDK.
    *   Note: `backend/integrations/gemini_client.py` was already using the new import style.

### C. Dependency Management
*   Acknowledged the list of 47+ outdated packages.
*   Created `DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_PLAN.md` outlining a 5-phase strategy for updating dependencies, prioritizing security and core framework updates.

---

## 3. Key Commits Pushed to GitHub

*   **`1786dbfa0`**: `ci: Optimize GitLab CI for faster dependency resolution`
    *   Initial `constraints.txt` updates and `.gitlab-ci.yml` optimizations.
*   **`487f7eace`**: `fix: Remove ports from GitLab CI neo4j service`
    *   Corrected `.gitlab-ci.yml` by removing disallowed `ports` key.
*   **`f54a9cb12`**: `docs: Add CI/CD dependency resolution fix documentation`
    *   Added `CI_DEPENDENCY_FIX.md`.
*   **`0a1d1cc17`**: `fix: Migrate to google-genai SDK from google-generativeai`
    *   Updated `requirements.txt` and `scripts/test_gemini_models.py`.
*   **`91323f697`**: `docs: Add comprehensive staged dependency update plan`
    *   Added `DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_PLAN.md`.

---

## 4. Current Project State

*   **GitHub `main` branch is fully updated** with all fixes and new documentation.
*   **GitLab `main` branch is outdated** and requires a manual sync from GitHub.
*   The GitLab CI pipeline configuration (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) and dependency constraints (`constraints.txt`) on GitHub are now robust and should prevent previous timeout issues.
*   The project now uses the correct `google-genai` SDK.
*   A detailed plan for updating other dependencies is in place (`DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_PLAN.md`).

## 5. Immediate Next Steps

1.  **Sync to GitLab (Manual)**:
    ```bash
    # On your local machine, ensure 'origin' points to GitHub and 'gitlab' points to GitLab
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git push gitlab main
    ```
2.  **Verify GitLab CI Pipeline**: After pushing to GitLab, monitor the new pipeline. It should pass without timeouts, especially the `lint` and `test` stages.
3.  **Begin Dependency Updates**: Start with **Phase 1** of the `DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_PLAN.md`, focusing on critical security updates (Pillow, aiohttp, sentry-sdk, web3, jinja2, python-multipart, slowapi).

## 6. What to Tell Droid in a Fresh Session

To quickly get back to this state with minimal context:

"Hi Droid, we just completed a session focused on fixing GitLab CI timeouts and managing dependencies.
Key actions taken:
1.  Updated `constraints.txt` and `.gitlab-ci.yml` to resolve CI timeouts (commits `1786dbfa0`, `487f7eace`). Documented in `CI_DEPENDENCY_FIX.md`.
2.  Migrated from `google-generativeai` to the `google-genai` SDK (commit `0a1d1cc17`).
3.  Created `DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_PLAN.md` (commit `91323f697`) for phased package updates.

The GitHub `main` branch has all these changes. I've synced these to GitLab.
The immediate next step is to start **Phase 1 of the `DEPENDENCY_UPDATE_PLAN.md`**, which involves updating critical security packages. Please review that plan and help me begin."

This should provide enough context to pick up where we left off.
