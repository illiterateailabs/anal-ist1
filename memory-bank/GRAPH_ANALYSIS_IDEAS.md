# Graph-Based Blockchain Analysis Ideas  
*File: `memory-bank/GRAPH_ANALYSIS_IDEAS.md` · living document*  
_Last updated: 2025-06-20_

> A curated backlog of **graph-centric analytics features** we can build with Sim (real-time multichain data), Dune, and Neo4j.  
> Each idea lists its purpose, technical path, integration points, and current status so we can prioritise & track progress over time.

Legend | Meaning  
:------|:--------  
Implemented | ✅ Live in codebase  
In-Progress | 🚧 Work started (open PR)  
Planned | 🔧 Road-mapped, no code yet  
Idea | 💡 Brainstormed concept

## 1. Transaction Flow Networks 💸  
**Status:** 🔧 Planned (next)  

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Goal** | Visualise how funds move between wallets & contracts across time / chains. |
| **Tech Notes** | Sim `activity` & `transactions` endpoints; stream to Neo4j as `(:Tx)-[:FROM]->(:Wallet)` relationships with amount/value_usd; optional aggregation window. |
| **Backend Tool** | `transaction_flow_tool.py` (future) – walks activity pages, groups by tx hash, emits `GraphAddEvent(type="flow_tx")`. |
| **Frontend Viz** | D3/Cytoscape force-graph; Sankey for large transfers; timeline scrubber. |
| **Use-Cases** | Money-laundering peel chains, funnel accounts, layer-by-layer analysis, AML report diagrams. |
| **KPIs / Alerts** | Depth > N sequential hops; total value moved; velocity; suspicious cycle detection. |

---

## 2. DeFi Protocol Interaction Map 🏗️  
**Status:** 💡 Idea  

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Goal** | Map wallet interactions with DEXs, lending, staking contracts; show protocol dependency graph. |
| **Data** | Sim `activity` → filter `call` events + decoded `function.name`; Token-Info for protocol tokens. |
| **Graph Schema** | `(Wallet)-[:INTERACTS_WITH {method,fee_usd}]->(Protocol)`; `(Protocol)-[:CATEGORY]->(:DeFiCategory)`. |
| **Frontend** | Sunburst of protocol categories, or hive plot segmented by protocol type. |
| **Benefits** | Detect yield-farming strategies, rug-pull exposure, identify protocol usage clusters. |

---

## 3. Cross-Chain Identity & Bridge Analysis 🌉  
**Status:** 🔧 Planned  

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Goal** | Track the *same economic actor* across chains via bridges & heuristics; reveal capital flight patterns. |
| **Sim Endpoints** | `balances`, `activity` on multiple `chain_ids`; bridge contract address list for tagging. |
| **Graph Logic** | `(Wallet{chain:X})-[:BRIDGE_TX]->(Wallet{chain:Y})` edges; unify with `cluster_id`. |
| **Coordination Detection** | Detect back-to-back outflow/inflow within < 5 min; flag as potential laundering. |
| **Viz** | Alluvial diagram of asset flows between chains; chord diagram of bridge volume. |
| **KPIs** | Volume bridged, chain flow delta, bridge risk score. |

---

## 4. Token Ecosystem / Relationship Network 🌐  
**Status:** 💡 Idea  

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Goal** | Connect tokens that share high-liquidity pools; visualize market ecosystem & correlation clusters. |
| **Data** | Sim `token-info` (pool_size, pool_type), DEX pool metadata. |
| **Graph** | `(Token)-[:POOL_WITH {liquidity_usd, dex}]->(Token)` weighted edges. |
| **Frontend** | Force-directed graph with edge thickness = liquidity; cluster coloring by category. |
| **Use-Cases** | Arbitrage route discovery, contagion risk if a token collapses. |

---

## 5. NFT Provenance & Collection Graphs 🖼️  
**Status:** 💡 Idea  

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Goal** | Trace NFT ownership history, detect wash-trading, visualize collection holder overlap. |
| **Data** | Sim `collectibles` + `activity` (NFT transfers); OpenSea metadata for images. |
| **Graph** | `(NFT)-[:MINTED_BY]->(Wallet)`, `(:Wallet)-[:OWNED_NFT {ts}]->(NFT)`; bipartite collection holder graph. |
| **Viz** | Sankey (mint → sales), bipartite graph, floor-price timeline overlays. |

---

## 6. Liquidity-Pool Network & Arbitrage Map 💱  
**Status:** 💡 Idea  

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Goal** | Show how tokens are linked through shared pools; identify triangular arbitrage paths. |
| **Data** | Sim `token-info` pool details; external DEX graph snapshots. |
| **Graph** | `(Pool)-[:CONTAINS]->(Token)`; run shortest-path queries for path-finding. |
| **Frontend** | Multi-layer network: tokens, pools, DEX nodes. |
| **Alerts** | Illiquid pool wallet-drains; sandwich attack risk. |

---

## 7. Whale Coordination Patterns 🐋  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented *(v1.7.0-beta)*  

Already live via **WhaleDetectionTool**: DISTRIBUTION | ACCUMULATION | CIRCULAR groups stored as coordination nodes.

**Extensions:**  
- Add graph-based centrality ranking for whales  
- Visual replay of coordination events  

---

## 8. Risk-Propagation Graphs ⚠️ (New Idea)  
**Status:** 💡 Idea  

Map how risk spreads through the network (e.g., low-liquidity token dumps → impacted wallets).

| Data | `token-info.low_liquidity`, transaction edges |
| Graph | Propagate risk score from risky token node through holder edges |
| Benefit | Early-warning system for contagion events |

---

## 9. Social Graph Overlays 📢 (New Idea)  
Combine on-chain wallet graph with off-chain social signals (ENS, Twitter handles).

| Data | ENS reverse records, Lens Protocol, Twitter tags |
| Graph | `(Wallet)-[:HAS_HANDLE]->(Social)`, overlay sentiments |
| Use | Influence mapping, phishing campaign detection |

---

## 10. Visualization Approaches  

| Technique | Library | Best For |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Force-Directed Graph | `d3-force`, `cytoscape.js` | General wallet/token networks |
| Sankey Diagram | `d3-sankey` | Fund flow & provenance |
| Chord / Alluvial | `d3-chord`, `Plotly` | Cross-chain & token-to-token volume |
| Hive / Sunburst | `d3-hierarchy` | Protocol category breakdown |
| Timeline Animations | `vis-timeline`, React Spring | Replay of flows over time |

---

## 11. Integration Checklist (per feature)

1. **Sim Data Mapping** – Identify endpoints & fields  
2. **Backend Tool** – Wrap API, validate schema, emit graph events  
3. **Neo4j Schema** – Define nodes/edges, indexes, constraints  
4. **Graph Jobs** – Batch or real-time ingestion workers  
5. **Frontend UI** – React component + visualization lib  
6. **Alerts / KPIs** – Define thresholds, Prometheus metrics  
7. **Docs & Tests** – Update memory-bank, add unit tests
