# Memory Bank ‚Äì Index & Navigation  
_Last updated: 03 Jun 2025_

Welcome to the **Memory Bank**, the single-source knowledge base for the **Analystt1** project.  
All living documentation is kept here; anything outside this directory is either code, tests, or legacy docs scheduled for removal.

## üî¨ Research Notes

All background studies and design spikes live under `research/`:

* `research/crewai-analystagent-factory.md` ‚Äì CrewAI factory design experiments  
* `research/crewai-analystagent.md` ‚Äì Early agent prompting strategies  
* `research/crypto-multichain-apis.md` ‚Äì On-chain data source comparison  
* `research/gemini-llm-provider-design.md` ‚Äì Gemini integration deep-dive  

_These docs are informative, not authoritative. Always cross-check with the core reference docs._

## üóëÔ∏è Legacy Docs

Files like `progress.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `CURRENT_STATUS_AND_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`, etc. are **deprecated**.  
They will be deleted once **PR #64** merges and the cleanup plan executes.  
Until removal they remain outside the Memory Bank to avoid confusion.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Updating the Memory Bank

1. **Edit** the relevant core doc (status, architecture, capabilities).  
2. Commit with message `docs: update <file> ‚Äì <short summary>`.  
3. No other markdown files should be introduced outside this directory without prior discussion.
