## 0 Â· QUICK START â€” What to tell the AI next time  
Copy-paste (or paraphrase) the following as the very first user message of the next session:

```
New session: load Memory Bank core files + session-handoff-2025-05-30.md.  
Focus on P0: verify CI pipeline is green on main, fix any lint/mypy/test failures.  
Then design HITL pause/resume workflow for `compliance_checker` (webhook draft + API endpoints).  
Ask for clarifications if needed.
```

## 1 Â· Session Summary (30 May 2025, UTC 14:00-22:45)  
| Time | Accomplishment |
|------|----------------|
| 14:00-17:30 | Implemented **Agent Prompt Management** (CRUD API `/api/v1/prompts`, React UI, hot-reload). PR #15 merged. |
| 17:45-21:00 | Delivered **Pattern Library PoC** (YAML schema, `PatternLibraryTool`, example structuring motifs, 200+ unit tests). PR #16 merged. |
| 21:10-22:30 | Added **Gemini 2.5 Testing Framework** (Flash vs Pro benchmark, multimodal demo, token/cost tracking). |

Coverage climbed to â‰ˆ 35 %, CI pipeline structure validated, main branch now includes all new features.

## 2 Â· Current Project State  
Component | Status | Notes
---|---|---
Backend FastAPI | ðŸŸ¢ stable | Health endpoints show build SHA & timestamp  
CrewAI Engine | ðŸŸ¢ sequential crews run | `crewai==0.5.0`  
Prompt Management | ðŸŸ¢ live | Runtime edit UI, defaults in YAML  
Pattern Library | ðŸŸ¢ PoC merged | Deterministic YAMLâ†’Cypher tool  
Gemini Integration | ðŸŸ¢ Flash & Pro tested | Testing script in `scripts/`  
HITL Workflow | ðŸ”´ not started | Top priority  
Prometheus Metrics | ðŸ”´ not started | Needed for observability  
Frontend UI | ðŸŸ¡ skeleton | Chat, graph panes empty; Prompt editor done  
CI Pipeline | ðŸŸ¡ running | May fail on stricter lint/mypy rules  
Test Coverage | 35 % | Target â‰¥ 50 % before Phase-2 close

## 3 Â· Next Priorities (ordered)  
Priority | Task | ETA | Owner next session
---|---|---|---
P0 | **Confirm CI green** â€” fix any lint, type or test failures on `main` | 0.5 d | You
P1 | **Design & implement HITL Workflow** for `compliance_checker` (pause, webhook, resume endpoint, minimal reviewer UI) | 2 d | You
P1 | **Add Prometheus metrics** (`crew_task_duration_seconds`, `llm_tokens_used_total`, `llm_cost_usd_total`) | 1 d | You
P2 | Front-end graph visual component (render JSON from `/crew/run`) | 2 d | â€”
P2 | Raise test coverage to â‰¥ 50 % (add HITL & graph tests) | ongoing | â€”

## 4 Â· Important Context & Decisions  
1. **Sequential crews** retained for MVP â€” guarantees auditability demanded by AML regulators.  
2. **Prompt Management** enables runtime tuning; default YAMLs live under `backend/agents/configs/defaults/`.  
3. **Pattern Library** uses canonical schema (`fraud_motifs_schema.yaml`) â€” all new motifs must follow it; conversion prefers template mode for performance.  
4. **Gemini 2.5** models:  
   â€¢ Flash = fast/cheap for simple tasksâ€ƒâ€¢ Pro = deep reasoningâ€ƒâ€¢ both support multimodal.  
   Testing framework (`scripts/test_gemini_models.py`) benchmarks and tracks cost.  
5. CI uses matrix (py39-41) + docker build; lint/mypy are strict (ruff / mypy --strict).  
6. Environment vars: `REQUIRE_NEO4J=true` in prod; dev can run without Neo4j.

## 5 Â· Things to Check / Verify Next Session  
- [ ] GitHub Actions badge on **main** is green; if not, open workflow logs and patch.  
- [ ] Prompt editor works end-to-end in dev container (login â†’ edit â†’ save â†’ run crew).  
- [ ] PatternLibraryTool can convert `STRUCT_001` and returns expected Cypher.  
- [ ] Gemini API key valid; run `python scripts/test_gemini_models.py --text` to sanity-check models.  
- [ ] Neo4j container healthy (`/health/neo4j` endpoint OK).  
- [ ] Docker prod compose still builds after merges.
