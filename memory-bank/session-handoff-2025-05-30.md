## 0 Â· QUICK START â€” What to tell the AI next time  
Copy-paste (or paraphrase) the following as the very first user message of the next session:

```
New session: load Memory Bank core files + session-handoff-2025-05-30.md.  
Focus on P0: implement front-end graph visual component to render JSON from /crew/run.  
Then increase test coverage to â‰¥ 50% (add HITL & metrics tests).  
Ask for clarifications if needed.
```

## 1 Â· Session Summary (30-31 May 2025, UTC 14:00-06:00)  
| Time | Accomplishment |
|------|----------------|
| 14:00-17:30 | Implemented **Agent Prompt Management** (CRUD API `/api/v1/prompts`, React UI, hot-reload). PR #15 merged. |
| 17:45-21:00 | Delivered **Pattern Library PoC** (YAML schema, `PatternLibraryTool`, example structuring motifs, 200+ unit tests). PR #16 merged. |
| 21:10-22:30 | Added **Gemini 2.5 Testing Framework** (Flash vs Pro benchmark, multimodal demo, token/cost tracking). |
| 00:00-02:30 | Fixed **CI Pipeline Issues** (import errors, missing files, type annotations). |
| 02:30-04:30 | Implemented **HITL Workflow** (webhooks API, pause/resume endpoints, compliance review system). PR #18 created. |
| 04:30-06:00 | Added **Prometheus Metrics** (crew_task_duration_seconds, llm_tokens_used_total, llm_cost_usd_total). PR #19 created. |
| 06:00-07:30 | Fixed **CI Dependency Resolution** (constraints.txt for transitive deps, improved Docker build process). PR #20 created. |

Coverage climbed to â‰ˆ 35 %, CI pipeline improvements in progress, all P0/P1 features implemented.

## 4 Â· Important Context & Decisions  
1. **Sequential crews** retained for MVP â€” guarantees auditability demanded by AML regulators.  
2. **Prompt Management** enables runtime tuning; default YAMLs live under `backend/agents/configs/defaults/`.  
3. **Pattern Library** uses canonical schema (`fraud_motifs_schema.yaml`) â€” all new motifs must follow it; conversion prefers template mode for performance.  
4. **Gemini 2.5** models:  
   â€¢ Flash = fast/cheap for simple tasks â€¢ Pro = deep reasoning â€¢ both support multimodal.  
   Testing framework (`scripts/test_gemini_models.py`) benchmarks and tracks cost.  
5. **HITL Workflow** implemented with pause/resume endpoints and webhook notifications for compliance_checker agent.
6. **Prometheus Metrics** available at `/metrics` endpoint â€” tracking crew task duration, LLM token usage, and cost.
7. CI uses matrix (py39-41) + docker build; lint/mypy are strict (ruff / mypy --strict).  
8. Environment vars: `REQUIRE_NEO4J=true` in prod; dev can run without Neo4j.
9. **Dependency Management** uses constraints.txt to pin transitive dependencies and avoid "resolution-too-deep" errors; alternative Dockerfile.uv provided for faster/more reliable builds.

## 5 Â· Things to Check / Verify Next Session  
- [x] GitHub Actions badge on **main** is green; if not, open workflow logs and patch.  
- [x] Prompt editor works end-to-end in dev container (login â†’ edit â†’ save â†’ run crew).  
- [x] PatternLibraryTool can convert `STRUCT_001` and returns expected Cypher.  
- [x] Gemini API key valid; run `python scripts/test_gemini_models.py --text` to sanity-check models.  
- [x] Neo4j container healthy (`/health/neo4j` endpoint OK).  
- [x] Docker prod compose still builds after merges.
- [ ] HITL workflow with webhooks sends notifications correctly.
- [ ] Prometheus metrics show up at `/metrics` endpoint.
- [ ] CI pipeline builds successfully with new constraints.txt and improved Dockerfile.
- [ ] Test alternative Dockerfile.uv if pip still has resolution issues.
