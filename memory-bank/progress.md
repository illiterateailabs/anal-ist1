# progress.md – Project Progress & Health  
_Last updated: **31 May 2025 08:00 UTC**_

## ✅ What Works Right Now
* FastAPI backend boots cleanly; `/health`, `/health/*` endpoints return build info & Git SHA.  
* Docker Compose **dev** profile spins up backend, frontend stub, Neo4j 5.15, Redis, Postgres.  
* CrewFactory initialisation with safe import-guards; can create crews & run smoke test via `/api/v1/crew/*`.  
* Core custom tools wrap Neo4j (`GraphQueryTool`) and e2b (`SandboxExecTool`) successfully.  
* **Agent Prompt Management System** – runtime CRUD API + React UI for editing agent prompts (PR #15).  
* **Pattern Library PoC** – YAML schema, PatternLibraryTool, example structuring patterns, 95 % unit-test coverage (PR #16).  
* **Gemini 2.5 Testing Framework** – flash vs pro comparison, multimodal demo, token/cost tracking.  
* **HITL Workflow** – pause/resume endpoints, webhook notifications, compliance review system (PR #18).  
* **Prometheus LLM Metrics** – automatic token & USD cost tracking via GeminiClient integration (PR #23).  
* **GraphVisualization MVP** – vis-network interactive view, PNG export (PR TBD).  
* Test coverage lifted to **≈ 35 %**.  
* Memory Bank core files maintained – single source of truth in repo.

## 🛠️ What's Left to Build (Phase-2 MVP)
1. **Increase coverage to ≥ 50 %** (add HITL & graph tests).  
2. **Cost Telemetry** – real-time Gemini token + USD tracking dashboard.  
3. **RBAC Enforcement** – apply decorators to protected endpoints.  
4. **Production Observability** – Loki/Sentry integration, SSE streaming.

## 🐞 Known Issues & Bugs
* Front-end skeleton still missing analysis & sandbox views.  
* Test coverage only ~35 %.  
* Graph JSON contract may evolve; UI schema validation missing.  
* HITL workflow needs integration tests and front-end review UI.  
* CI pipeline failing with "resolution-too-deep" errors during dependency installation (spacy/confection conflict).

## 📅 31 May 2025 – Session 3
| Time (UTC) | Focus | Outcome |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| 00:00-02:30 | **CI Pipeline Fixes (P0)** | Fixed import errors, missing files, type annotations. |
| 02:30-04:30 | **HITL Workflow (P1)** | Implemented webhooks API, pause/resume endpoints, compliance review system. PR #18 created. |
| 04:30-06:00 | **CI Dependency Fixes (P0)** | Fixed "resolution-too-deep" errors by downgrading spacy, adding constraints.txt for transitive dependencies, improving Dockerfile pip strategy. |
| 06:00-07:00 | **Prometheus LLM Metrics (P0)** | Integrated cost & token counters into GeminiClient; TODO list updated. |
| 07:00-08:00 | **GraphVisualization MVP (P1)** | Built vis-network component with PNG export; integrated into main page. |

### Delta
* Coverage maintained at **35 %** (new GraphVisualization needs tests).  
* Component statuses updated (Frontend now 🟡 with MVP graph).  
* **GraphVisualization MVP implemented; front-end graph task removed from TODO list.**  
* Added PNG export feature via vis-network.  
* Updated progress timestamp and TODO numbering.
