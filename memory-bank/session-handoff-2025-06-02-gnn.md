## 1 ▪ Session Overview & Context
| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Date / Time (UTC)** | 02 Jun 2025 &nbsp;10:00 – 12:30 |
| **Goal** | Add state-of-the-art Graph Neural Network (GNN) capability to analystt1 for advanced fraud detection across traditional finance and crypto graphs. |
| **Scope** | Training, inference, analysis, hyper-parameter tuning, experiment tracking, Neo4j data extraction and PyG conversion. |
| **Outcome** | Fully-featured GNN tool-chain merged to feature branch with PR #60. |

## 2 ▪ Technical Achievements
1. **GNNFraudDetectionTool**
   * End-to-end pipeline (train / predict / analyze).
   * Supports **GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE** via a unified `GNNModel`.
   * Neo4j subgraph extraction → PyTorch Geometric `Data`.
   * Risk scoring, suspicious-pattern heuristics, vis-network JSON generation.
2. **GNNTrainingTool**
   * Training strategies: **supervised, semi-, self- & unsupervised**.
   * **Optuna** tuner (AUC/F1/loss objectives).
   * **ExperimentTracker** → versioned runs, metrics log, model artefacts.
   * Cross-validation & early-stopping; configurable masks for semi-supervised.
3. **Infrastructure**
   * GPU/CPU automatic device selection.
   * Model save/load (`.pt`) with metadata schema.
   * Precision-recall, confusion matrix, classification report utilities.
4. **Documentation & Progress**
   * `progress.md` updated with new session block.
   * Comprehensive PR description with architecture diagram & next steps.

## 3 ▪ Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/agents/tools/gnn_fraud_detection_tool.py` | Primary runtime tool for agents: train, predict, analyze, explain. |
| `backend/agents/tools/gnn_training_tool.py` | Dedicated training/experiment CLI-style tool with tuning & tracking. |
| _Models & experiment folders_ (`models/gnn/*`, `experiments/gnn/*`) | Created at runtime for artefacts; paths defined in constants. |
| **(Doc)** `memory-bank/progress.md` | Status table updated to include GNN milestone. |

---

## 4 ▪ Integration Points
* **CrewFactory** — add new tools in `backend/agents/factory.py` for utilisation by `fraud_pattern_hunter` and future *gnn_analyst* agents.  
* **Neo4jClient** — utilised for subgraph extraction; no code change required.  
* **e2b sandbox** — unchanged; GNN tools run in-process PyTorch.  
* **Frontend** — Graph vis network already consumes `visualization_data` JSON emitted by tool.  
* **Prometheus metrics** — reuse existing token/cost hooks; extend to record GPU time (TODO).

## 5 ▪ Key Technical Decisions
| Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| **PyTorch Geometric** over DGL | Smaller dependency set, good community, simpler install in CI. |
| **Unified GNNModel class** | Minimises duplicate code while supporting multiple conv layers. |
| **Optuna for tuning** | Lightweight, async-friendly, integrates with PyTorch loops easily. |
| **ExperimentTracker local FS** | Fast to implement; future upgrade path to MLflow/S3. |
| **Edge-list tensor storage** | Avoid heterogeneous graph for v1; extend later if needed. |

## 6 ▪ Pull Request Details
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **PR #** | **60** — “Implement Graph Neural Networks for Advanced Fraud Detection” |
| **Branch** | `droid/gnn-fraud-detection` |
| **Base** | `main` |
| **Status** | _Open_ — ready for review |
| **Commits** | Single squash commit `f314e2d` containing both tool files. |
| **CI** | Passed unit tests; additional GNN tests TBD. |
| **Review Notes** | Focus on dependency size, GPU workflow, security of Neo4j query building. |

---

## 7 ▪ Next Steps & Recommendations
1. **Wire Tools into CrewFactory**  
   `factory.py` → register both tools; create sample agent config.
2. **Add Test Coverage (~55 %)**  
   * Unit tests: model forward, trainer early-stop, Optuna objective.  
   * Integration: end-to-end train → predict on toy graph.
3. **Docker GPU Image**  
   New `Dockerfile.gpu` with `torch==2.3.0+cu121` & `pyg` wheels.
4. **Frontend Enhancements**  
   Visualise fraud_probability heatmap; add GNN training dashboard.
5. **Model Registry**  
   Migrate `ExperimentTracker` to S3/MLflow for multi-node training.
6. **Additional Architectures**  
   Evaluate Graph Transformer or HGT for heterogeneous graphs.

---

## 8 ▪ Technical Debt & Future Considerations
* **Heterogeneous Graph Support** — current model treats all nodes equally; need type-specific layers for production accuracy.  
* **Feature Engineering** — only numeric properties ingested; categorical/bool skipped.  
* **Scalability** — `apoc.path.subgraphAll` may time-out on very large graphs. Move to batch sampling or Pregel procedures.  
* **Security** — Ensure Cypher injection safe; validate any user-supplied IDs.  
* **GPU Availability in CI** — training tests skipped when no CUDA; consider mocking.  
* **Explainability** — placeholder explainer; integrate GNNExplainer / Captum for prod.  
* **Dependency Size** — PyG adds ~600 MB; monitor container size and build cache.
