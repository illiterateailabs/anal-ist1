# activeContext.md – Live Session Log  

**Session:** 02 Jun 2025 · 13:00 UTC  
**Droid:** Factory assistant (`illiterate ai`)  
**Active branch:** `droid/gnn-fraud-detection`  
**Goal:** Complete Graph Neural Networks (GNN) implementation & integration for advanced fraud detection.

---

## 🏗️ Work in Progress (WIP)
| Area | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| **GNN Implementation** | Core tools (`GNNFraudDetectionTool`, `GNNTrainingTool`) | ✅ PR #60 |
| **CrewFactory Wiring** | Register GNN tools, create sample *gnn_analyst* agent | ⏳ next |
| **Test Coverage ≥ 55 %** | Add unit & integration tests for GNN paths | ⏳ |
| **Redis JWT Blacklist** | Persistent token blacklist (P1-1) | ⏳ |
| **PolicyDocsTool** | Vector search integration (P1-2) | ⏳ |

---

## 🚀 Next Immediate Tasks (next 4 h)
1. **Review & merge PR #60** – “Implement Graph Neural Networks for Advanced Fraud Detection”.  
2. **Wire GNN tools into CrewFactory** and add sample agent configuration.  
3. **Write GNN unit/integration tests** to raise coverage past 55 %.  
4. **Begin Redis blacklist refactor** once GNN merged.  
5. **Draft Docker GPU image plan** for PyG + CUDA.

---

## 📝 Recent Decisions & Context
* **GNN milestone achieved** – PyTorch Geometric chosen; supports GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE.  
* **Optuna adopted** for hyper-parameter tuning; local FS experiment tracker v1 implemented.  
* **Unified `GNNModel`** reduces duplicate architecture code.  
* **Neo4j subgraph extraction** via APOC path; placeholder explainability to be upgraded.  
* **PR #60** houses all GNN code; awaiting review.

---

## 🔧 Critical Issues Being Addressed
* ⏳ **CrewFactory wiring** to expose GNN capabilities to agents.  
* ⏳ **Comprehensive tests** for new tools to maintain CI stability.  
* ⏳ **Redis blacklist** still in-memory only.  
* ⏳ **Docker GPU build** required for production training workloads.

---

## ⛔ Blockers / Dependencies
* **PR #60 must merge** before downstream wiring & tests.  
* **GPU image** planning needed for CI/CD before heavy training.  
* **Feature branches** dependent on Redis refactor will wait until GNN integrated.

_If you pick up this session, start by reviewing PR #60; once merged, proceed with CrewFactory integration and test suite expansion._
