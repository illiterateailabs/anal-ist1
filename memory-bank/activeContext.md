# activeContext.md – Live Session Log  

**Session:** 31 May 2025 · 12:45 UTC  
**Droid:** Factory assistant (`illiterate ai`)  
**Active branch:** `droid/complete-implementation-gaps`  
**Goal:** Close Phase-2 MVP implementation gaps so the stack runs end-to-end with ≥ 50 % test coverage.

## 🏗️ Work in Progress (WIP)
| Area | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Agent YAMLs | Add `graph_analyst`, `compliance_checker`, `report_writer`, crypto agents | ⏳ drafting |
| Tools | Implement `TemplateEngineTool`, `PolicyDocsTool`; finish `CodeGenTool` execution path | ⏳ scaffolding |
| RBAC/Auth | Protect `/crew/run`, `/analysis/*`; unit-test 401/403/200 flows | ⏳ not started |
| Tests | Extend to HITL, tools edge-cases, front-end graph schema | ⏳ test stubs |
| Docs | Align README / ROADMAP with real status | ✅ progress.md updated |

## 🚀 Next Immediate Tasks (P0 / next 4 h)
1. **Write missing agent YAMLs** in `backend/agents/configs/defaults/` (graph_analyst, compliance_checker, report_writer).  
2. **Code & unit-test `TemplateEngineTool`** – must render Markdown using Jinja2 templates.  
3. **Add RBAC decorator** utility and guard `/api/v1/crew/run`.  
4. **Expand test coverage to ≥ 45 %** by adding tool tests (TemplateEngineTool success + failure).  
5. Commit & push → open PR draft for review.

## 📝 Recent Decisions & Context
* Keep **sequential crew pattern** for auditability.  
* CI fixed via `constraints.txt`; pipeline now green.  
* Prometheus metrics integrated; cost counters exposed.  
* Docker **prod profile** still WIP – moved to P1 after core gaps filled.  

---

## 🔧 Critical Issues Being Addressed
* Runtime falls back to default prompts due to **missing agent configs** → breaks role-aligned reasoning.  
* `TemplateEngineTool` & `PolicyDocsTool` exist only as stubs → report generation & compliance checks fail.  
* RBAC only guards `/prompts` & `/graph` → potential security hole on `/crew/run`.  
* Test coverage at **≈ 40 %**; CI gating requires ≥ 50 % before Phase-2 sign-off.

---

## ⛔ Blockers / Dependencies
* **Frontend auth flow** missing – JWT must be crafted manually; not blocking backend tests but needed for E2E.  
* **Redis persistence** for rate-limit store not configured – defer to infra hardening after core gaps.  
* **Time** – tight window before Phase-2 review tomorrow; focus strictly on P0 tasks.
