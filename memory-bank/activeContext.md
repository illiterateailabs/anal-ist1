# activeContext.md – Live Session Log  

**Session:** 01 Jun 2025 · 14:30 UTC  
**Droid:** Factory assistant (`illiterate ai`)  
**Active branch:** `fix/P0-quick-wins`  
**Goal:** Implement P0 quick wins and prepare for P0-1 CodeGenTool integration.

---

## 🏗️ Work in Progress (WIP)
| Area | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| P0 Quick Wins | RBAC guards, Alembic setup, failing test | ✅ PR #44 |
| CodeGenTool Integration | P0-1 result flow | ⏳ next after merge |
| Redis JWT Blacklist | P1-1 implementation | ⏳ not started |
| PolicyDocsTool | P1-2 vector retrieval | ⏳ not started |
| Test Coverage | Raise to ≥55% | ⏳ at 50% now |

---

## 🚀 Next Immediate Tasks (P0 / next 4 h)
1. **Wait for PR #44 CI** – ensure all tests pass (except intentional CodeGen failure).
2. **After merge, create branch** `fix/P0-1-codegen-results`.
3. **Implement CodeGenTool result integration** – make failing test pass.
4. **Test end-to-end** with fraud_investigation crew.
5. **Open PR for P0-1** with full implementation.

---

## 📝 Recent Decisions & Context
* **P0 quick wins completed** in 2.5 hours – security gaps closed.
* **TDD approach** for CodeGenTool – test written first.
* **CI updated** to run Alembic migrations automatically.
* **RBAC now protects** all sensitive crew and analysis endpoints.

---

## 🔧 Critical Issues Being Addressed
* ✅ **RBAC security gap** on `/crew/run` – now protected.
* ✅ **Database migrations** – automated in Docker & CI.
* ⏳ **CodeGenTool results** not reaching subsequent agents.
* ⏳ **Redis blacklist** still in-memory only.

---

## ⛔ Blockers / Dependencies
* **PR #44 must merge** before starting P0-1 implementation.
* **Test coverage gate** will need adjustment after P1-4.
* **Time** – aiming to complete P0-1 today, P1 items over next week.

_If you pick up this session, check PR #44 status first. If merged, proceed with P0-1 implementation._
