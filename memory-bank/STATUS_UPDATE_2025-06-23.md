## 1. Observability & Ops
| ID | Task | Status | Evidence |
|----|------|--------|----------|
| 1-0 | Wire OpenTelemetry SDK → OTLP | ✓ | `backend/core/telemetry.py`, mounted in `backend/main.py` (startup event `initialize_telemetry`) |
| 1-1 | Grafana dashboards for p99, spend, queue depth | 🟥 | ‑ |
| 1-2 | Replace brute-force vector search with Redis HNSW | ✓ | `backend/core/graph_rag.py` (Redis `FT.SEARCH`), provider config in `backend/providers/registry.yaml` |
| 1-3 | Prometheus alert rules (budget, circuit open) | 🟥 | ‑ |
| 1-4 | Metrics env-vars templated in compose files | ⏳ | `docker-compose.yml` contains `PROM_*`; prod file still hard-coded |

## 2. Back-Pressure & Cost Control
| Task | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| BackpressureMiddleware mounted | ✓ | `backend/main.py` → `app.add_middleware(BackpressureMiddleware)` |
| Provider registry with budget/rate/cost rules | ✓ | `backend/providers/registry.yaml` |
| Emit `external_api_credit_used_total` from clients | ⏳ | Implemented in `integrations/gemini_client.py`; **SIM** client still TODO |
| Emergency budget protection unit test | 🟥 | missing in `tests/` |

## 3. Security Hardening
| Task | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Secure access/refresh cookies, rotation | ⏳ | `backend/auth/secure_cookies.py` scaffold present, not enforced in `auth.py` |
| SlowAPI rate-limit middleware | 🟥 | ‑ |
| Dynamic CORS origins | ⏳ | `backend/main.py` uses ENV in DEBUG but prod list is static |

## 4. Scalability & Jobs
| Task | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Celery + Redis worker system | ✓ | `backend/jobs/celery_app.py`, `backend/jobs/tasks/*`, startup hook `initialize_jobs` |
| Worker health endpoint & metrics | ⏳ | `backend/jobs/worker_monitor.py` exists – endpoint not exposed |

## 5. Graph Roadmap
| Task | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Explain-with-Cypher intercept & store | ✓ | `backend/core/explain_cypher.py` + hook in `GraphQueryTool` |
| DeFi Protocol Map (Idea #2) | 🟥 | ‑ |
| Token Ecosystem Network (Idea #4) | 🟥 | ‑ |
| Redis path-cache for wallet pairs | 🟥 | ‑ |

## 6. Developer Experience
| Task | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Pre-commit lint hooks for frontend | ✓ | `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (`eslint-frontend`, `prettier-frontend`) |
| Typed OpenAPI client generation | 🟥 | ‑ |
| Playwright e2e CI flow | 🟥 | ‑ |
| Dead in-memory store removed | ✓ | `backend/api/v1/chat.py` cleansed (commit 3d667d9) |

## 7. Deployment / DevOps
| Task | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Helm chart | 🟥 | ‑ |
| GitHub Actions deploy workflow | 🟥 | only `ci.yml` present |
| Kustomize overlays | 🟥 | ‑ |

## 8. Quick Wins (from TODO)
All four quick-wins marked complete — verified by commits `eb6d80d`, `e26a762`, `3d667d9`.

## 9. Phase-5 & Use-Case Epics
25 epics listed in TODO; none have production-ready code yet. Design work only.

> **Next High-Impact Moves**  
> 1. Add Grafana dashboards + Prometheus alerts to close Ops gap.  
> 2. Implement SIM client cost metric emission to fully activate budget guard.  
> 3. Introduce SlowAPI rate-limiter and secure-cookie refresh logic.  
> 4. Expose worker health endpoint for Celery in `backend/api/v1/health.py`.
