# Contributing to **analystt1**

First off â€” thanks for taking the time to contribute!  
This guide explains the tooling, workflow and quality standards we follow so that changes land quickly and safely.

## 1 Â· How We Work â€“ High-Level Flow

```
Fork â†’ Branch â†’ Code & Test â†’ Commit â†’ Push â†’ Pull Request â†’ Review â†’ Merge
```

1. **Every change happens through a Pull Request (PR)** â€“ even docs.  
2. **CI must be green** â€“ tests, lint and type-checks run automatically.  
3. **At least one approving review** is required before merge to `main`.

## 2 Â· Developer Environment

| Step | Command / Notes |
|------|-----------------|
| Clone repo | `git clone https://github.com/illiterateailabs/analystt1.git` |
| Create Python venv | `python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate` |
| Install backend deps | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Install frontend deps | `cd frontend && npm install && cd ..` |
| Copy env file | `cp .env.example .env` â€“ fill in API keys |
| Start services | `docker-compose up -d neo4j postgres redis` |
| Run app locally | `make dev` (spins up backend & frontend) |
| Pre-commit hooks | `pre-commit install` (runs lint, codespell, mdformat) |
| Tests | `pytest -q && npm run test` |

## 3 Â· Branching Strategy

| Branch prefix | Use for | CI target |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| `feat/<name>` | New features / epics | Full matrix |
| `fix/<name>`  | Bug fixes | Affected jobs |
| `docs/<name>` | Docs only | Lint + link check |
| `hotfix/<name>` | Critical production issues | Fast-track |

Guidelines:

* Branch off **`main`**; keep them short-lived (< 1 week).  
* **Rebase** onto `main` before opening / updating a PR â€“ avoid merge commits.  
* Delete the branch after the PR is merged.

## 4 Â· Commit Style (Conventional Commits)

```
<type>(scope): <subject>
<blank line>
<body>  # optional
```

| Type        | When to use                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `feat`      | New feature or capability                    |
| `fix`       | Bug fix                                      |
| `docs`      | Documentation only                           |
| `refactor`  | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `test`      | Adding or updating tests                     |
| `chore`     | Build tasks, CI, tooling                     |

Examples:

```
feat(neo4j): add APOC pathfinding support
fix(auth): correct JWT expiry validation
docs(roadmap): mark phase-3 as complete
```
