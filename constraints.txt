# constraints.txt - Explicit constraints for transitive dependencies
# This file helps pip resolve complex dependency graphs by providing explicit version bounds
# for packages that might cause conflicts or "resolution-too-deep" errors.
# This file is crucial for mitigating CI pipeline timeouts caused by complex dependency resolution.

# Common dependency that causes conflicts across ML libraries
typing_extensions>=4.8.0,<5.0.0

# Constraints added to mitigate pip backtracking issues observed in CI (May 31, 2025)
# These help stabilize the dependency resolution for complex packages like
# google-cloud-aiplatform, crewai.
grpcio~=1.62.2
grpcio-status~=1.62.2
# langchain-core and langchain-community removed as they are not directly used and add significant dependency overhead.
huggingface-hub~=0.20.3
googleapis-common-protos~=1.69.0
# Pinning protobuf as it's a common source of conflict with google libraries
protobuf~=4.25.0
Deprecated==1.2.15

# Chromadb constraint to ensure compatibility with crewai's memory feature. Pinned to a specific version to avoid resolution issues.
chromadb==0.5.23

# SQLAlchemy constraint to match our pinned version in requirements.txt
sqlalchemy==2.0.30

# Pydantic constraints to ensure compatibility
pydantic>=2.7.0,<2.8.0
