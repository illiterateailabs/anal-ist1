# constraints.txt - Explicit constraints for transitive dependencies
# This file helps pip resolve complex dependency graphs by providing explicit version bounds
# for packages that might cause conflicts or "resolution-too-deep" errors.

# Constraints added to mitigate pip backtracking issues observed in CI (May 31, 2025)
# These help stabilize the dependency resolution for complex packages like
# google-cloud-aiplatform, langchain, crewai.
