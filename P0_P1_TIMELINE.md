## Implementation Timeline for P0/P1 Tasks

This Gantt chart visualizes the implementation schedule for addressing all P0 (Critical) and P1 (High Priority) gaps. The timeline shows dependencies, parallel work streams, and realistic timeframes based on effort estimates.

## Timeline Explanation

### Week 1: Critical Fixes (P0)
- **Day 1 (Jun 1)**: Quick wins - Alembic migration (P0-3) and RBAC guard (P0-2)
- **Day 2-3 (Jun 2-3)**: CodeGenTool result integration (P0-1)
- **Day 2 (Jun 2)**: Begin Redis JWT blacklist (P1-1) in parallel with CodeGenTool

### Week 1-2: High Priority (P1) - Parallel Streams
- **Backend Stream**:
  - **Day 2 (Jun 2)**: Redis JWT blacklist (P1-1)
  - **Day 4-6 (Jun 4-6)**: PolicyDocsTool vector retrieval (P1-2)
  
- **Frontend Stream**:
  - **Day 4-7 (Jun 4-7)**: Analysis View implementation (P1-3)

### Week 2: Test Coverage Improvements
- **Day 7-8 (Jun 7-8)**: Backend test coverage (after PolicyDocsTool)
- **Day 8-9 (Jun 8-9)**: Frontend test coverage (after Analysis View)

## Work Allocation & Parallelization

| Stream | Owner | Tasks | Timeline |
|--------|-------|-------|----------|
| **Critical Security** | Backend Lead | P0-3, P0-2 | Day 1 |
| **Core Backend** | Backend Dev 1 | P0-1, P1-2 | Day 2-6 |
| **Auth Backend** | Backend Dev 2 | P1-1 | Day 2 |
| **Frontend** | Frontend Dev | P1-3 | Day 4-7 |
| **QA** | Test Engineer | P1-4a, P1-4b | Day 7-9 |

## Dependencies & Critical Path

The critical path runs through:
1. P0-3 (Alembic) → P0-2 (RBAC) → P0-1 (CodeGen) → P1-2 (PolicyDocs) → P1-4a (Backend Tests)

This path determines the minimum timeline (9 days) for completing all P0/P1 items.

## Milestones

1. **Security Baseline**: End of Day 1 - Critical auth fixes deployed
2. **Core Functionality**: End of Day 3 - CodeGenTool integration complete
3. **Backend Feature Complete**: End of Day 6 - All backend P1 items done
4. **Frontend Feature Complete**: End of Day 7 - Analysis View ready
5. **Quality Gate**: End of Day 9 - 55% test coverage achieved

## Resource Optimization

- Backend developers can be assigned to P0 tasks first, then split to work on P1-1 and P1-2 in parallel
- Frontend work can begin as soon as P0-1 is complete (Day 4)
- Test coverage work is deliberately scheduled last to cover all new implementations
- Daily standups will help identify any blocking issues and adjust assignments

## Contingency

- 20% buffer added to timeline estimates
- If P1-2 (PolicyDocsTool) proves more complex, it can be descoped to a simpler implementation with reduced functionality
- Analysis View (P1-3) can be deployed incrementally with basic functionality first
