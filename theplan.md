1. Introduction
1.1. Vision and Purpose

This master plan details the development of the "Analyst's Augmentation Agent," an AI system to revolutionize analyst workflows across domains like finance and research.
Vision: An indispensable AI partner integrating multimodal understanding, graph analytics, secure code execution, and standardized tool use to automate tasks, uncover insights, and empower data-driven strategies.
Purpose: This definitive blueprint consolidates prior research, offering a comprehensive guide for development teams.
1.2. Core Technologies & Rationale

    Google's Multimodal LLMs (e.g., Gemini API): The agent's "brain" for NLU, reasoning, code generation (Python, Cypher), and multimodal processing (text, images).

    Neo4j (Graph Database): The "memory" for complex, interconnected data, crucial for financial analysis, fraud detection, and knowledge graphs. Features Cypher, GDS, and vector search.

    e2b.dev (Secure Cloud Execution Environment): The "secure hands" providing isolated Firecracker microVMs for AI-generated code execution. Offers speed, scalability, and AI-centric design.

    Model Context Protocol (MCP): The "universal adapter" for standardized agent-tool interaction (discovery, invocation) via Gemini.

    Python: The primary "connective tissue" for agent logic, integrating all core technologies.

1.3. Guiding Principles

    Analyst-Centricity: Address analyst needs directly.

    Modularity & Extensibility: Allow easy addition of tools and modules.

    Security by Design: Prioritize robust security.

    Transparency & Explainability (XAI): Provide insights into agent reasoning.

    Iterative Development: Phased approach with analyst feedback.

2. Comprehensive Agent Architecture

A modular system for scalability and maintainability.

    A. User Interface (UI) / API Layer:

        Function: Analyst interaction (web chat/dashboard) and programmatic access.

        Technology: Web framework (React/Next.js for UI, FastAPI/Flask for API), SSE for real-time updates.

        Interaction: NL queries, file uploads (text, images, CSVs), task definition, result reception.

    B. Orchestration & Reasoning Core (Powered by Gemini):

        Function: Central intelligence: interprets requests, plans tasks, generates code, uses MCP tools, interacts with Neo4j, synthesizes information.

        Technology: Python application using Gemini API.

        Sub-Modules: Multimodal Input Processor, NLU & Intent Recognition, Task Planner & Decomposer, Code Generation Engine, Tool Interaction Manager (MCP Client), Result Synthesizer & Formatter.

    C. e2b.dev Secure Execution Engine:

        Function: Executes AI-generated/user code in secure sandboxes. Handles data processing, model inference, tool interactions.

        Technology: Python module using e2b.dev SDK.

        Operations: Sandbox lifecycle management, file I/O, script execution (on-the-fly dependency install), artifact retrieval, hosting MCP tools.

    D. Neo4j Graph Data & Analytics Layer:

        Function: Stores and manages interconnected data. Provides graph query and analytics.

        Technology: Neo4j instance (AuraDB/self-hosted). Python via neo4j driver.

        Sub-Modules: Graph Schema Manager, Data Ingestion Pipelines, Cypher Query Executor, Graph Data Science (GDS) Interface, Vector Index & Search Module.

    E. External Tools & Services (Accessed via MCP & Direct APIs):

        Function: Access to external capabilities and data sources.

        Technology: MCP-compliant tools; direct APIs.

        Examples: Financial/news APIs, threat intel, GitHub, analytical services.

    F. State Management & Persistence Layer:

        Function: Manages conversation context, task progress, user profiles, agent knowledge, workflow state.

        Technology: Session State (e2b.dev pausable sandboxes), Persistent State (e.g., PostgreSQL).

Data & Control Flow Example (Multimodal Query):

    Analyst uploads image (e.g., transaction diagram), asks UI: "Identify money laundering pattern, list entities."

    UI sends to Orchestration Core.

    Gemini (Input Processor) analyzes image.

    Gemini (NLU & Planner) plans: represent diagram in Neo4j, run graph algorithms, interpret results.

    Gemini (Code Gen) creates Cypher queries and Python script (Neo4j driver, GDS).

    Orchestration Core sends script to e2b.dev Engine.

    e2b.dev Engine provisions sandbox, executes script (connects to Neo4j, runs Cypher/GDS), returns results.

    Orchestration Core (Result Synthesizer - Gemini) interprets, generates NL explanation.

    Response to UI.
