# 🗺️ Analyst's Augmentation Agent – Development Roadmap  

_Last updated: **02 Jun 2025**_

---

## ✅ Phase 1 Complete – Core Foundation & PoC  

All foundational plumbing is live and battle-tested.

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Project Structure & Tooling** | ✔ | Modular backend / frontend, Docker dev profile |
| **FastAPI Backend** | ✔ | Async, CORS, global error handling, health endpoints |
| **Next.js Frontend** | ✔ | Chat & graph panels, Tailwind CSS |
| **Gemini Integration** | ✔ | Flash & Pro models, text + multimodal |
| **Neo4j Graph Layer** | ✔ | Async driver, base schema, APOC + GDS plugins |
| **e2b Secure Execution** | ✔ | Firecracker micro-VMs for sandboxed code |
| **NLQ → Cypher PoC** | ✔ | Few-shot Gemini prompts convert NL to Cypher |
| **Image Analysis PoC** | ✔ | Gemini multimodal demo extracts entities |
| **Docker Infrastructure** | ✔ | Neo4j, Postgres, Redis, optional Jupyter |
| **Startup Scripts** | ✔ | `make dev` / `docker-compose up` one-liner |

## 🏆 Phase 2 Complete – MVP for Financial Crime Analysis  

The platform now delivers an end-to-end workflow for crypto + TradFi fraud investigation.

### 🎯 Key Achievements  
- [x] **Authentication & Security** – JWT access/refresh, bcrypt hashing, Redis blacklist, role-based access (RBAC).  
- [x] **Agent Configurations** – All five core agents: `nlq_translator`, `graph_analyst`, `fraud_pattern_hunter`, `compliance_checker`, `report_writer`.  
- [x] **Pattern Library** – 30 + fraud patterns (wash-trading, pump-and-dump, rug-pull, flash-loan, etc.).  
- [x] **Crypto Fraud Detection Stack** – `CryptoAnomalyTool` (time-series, wash trading, pump-and-dump) & `CryptoCSVLoaderTool` (CSV → Neo4j ingest).  
- [x] **HITL Workflow** – Pause/resume, compliance review UI, approval history.  
- [x] **Test Coverage ≈ 50 %** – Unit + integration + E2E; CI gates.  
- [x] **CI/CD** – GitHub Actions matrix (lint, mypy, tests, Docker build).  
- [x] **Docker Production Setup** – Multistage backend image, Nginx-served frontend, health-checks.  
- [x] **Prometheus Metrics** – Token usage, cost counters, crew duration.  

### 📈 Outcomes  
Analysts can ingest on-chain CSVs, run pattern & ML detection, view Neo4j graphs, pause tasks for compliance, and generate executive reports – all secured by JWT & RBAC with automated CI pipelines.

## 🎉 Phase 3 Complete – Integrations & Ecosystem  

| Epic | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **MCP Integration** | Implement Model Context Protocol client/server so Gemini can auto-discover external tools. |
| **External Data APIs** | SEC filings, sanctions lists, market data, on-chain indexers. |
| **Observability & Reliability** | OpenTelemetry traces, Loki logs, Grafana dashboards; retry/circuit breaking. |
| **Coverage > 55 %** | Front-end component tests, Playwright E2E, additional tool edge-cases. |
| **Production Hardening** | Helm charts / k8s manifests, secret management, infra as code. |
| **Advanced Schema & Risk Propagation** | Temporal relationships, risk score propagation, UBO hierarchies. |

## 🚀 Phase 4 – Advanced AI & “Data Detective” (Current Focus)  

| Epic | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Graph Neural Networks** | Node embedding & link-prediction for fraud discovery. |
| **Explainable AI** | SHAP / attention heat-maps for analyst trust. |
| **Automatic Hypothesis Generation** | LLMs propose investigative paths based on graph patterns. |
| **Active Learning Pipelines** | Analysts label results to improve models iteratively. |
| **GraphQL Public API** | Unified GraphQL interface for third-party integrations and dashboards. |
| **Self-Serve Tenant Onboarding** | Wizard & automated provisioning for new enterprise tenants. |

### 📊 Success Metrics Snapshot  

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Core services uptime | 95 % | 93 % |
| API P95 latency | < 500 ms | 480 ms |
| Fraud pattern recall | > 90 % on test set | 87 % |
| Test coverage | 55 % | 52 % |
| Analyst satisfaction | > 4 / 5 | TBD |
