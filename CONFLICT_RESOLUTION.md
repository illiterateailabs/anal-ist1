# Branch Conflict Resolution Report  
_Repository:_ `illiterateailabs/androidanalist`  
_Date:_ 2025-06-18

## 1. Executive Summary
Three active branches (and their Pull Requests) entered a **circular-merge scenario** that GitHub cannot auto-resolve:

| PR | Head → Base | Status | Problem |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|
| **#76** | `droid/ux-transformation` → `main` | open | Normal direction, but conflicts |
| **#78** | `main` → `droid/ux-transformation` | open | **Backwards merge** – introduced loop |
| **#77** | `droid/mvp-integration` → `main` | merged | Introduced new files that clash with UX work |

Because PR #78 tries to merge *main* back into the feature branch while PR #76 merges the same feature branch into *main*, the two PRs disagree on file histories and lock each other.

---

## 2. Root-Cause Analysis

1. **Reverse Pull Request**  
   Someone mistakenly opened PR #78 with the wrong base/head ordering. This created an opposing merge graph.

2. **Diverging Histories After PR #77**  
   `droid/mvp-integration` (merged) added `Shell.tsx`, `frontend/src/store/investigation.ts`, and refactored auth hooks.  
   Meanwhile `droid/ux-transformation` was developed in parallel and touched the _same_ files.

3. **Overlapping File Edits**  
   The following files have conflicting changes (different commits touching identical lines):

   ```
   frontend/src/components/layout/Shell.tsx
   frontend/src/store/investigation.ts
   frontend/src/hooks/useAuth.ts
   frontend/package.json  (dependency bumps)
   ```

   Git cannot auto-merge these hunks because each branch inserts different implementations.

---

## 3. Impact

* CI blocked – neither PR can merge.
* Team velocity slowed – new work queues behind the conflict.
* Risk of losing work if a hard reset were attempted without coordination.

---

## 4. Resolution Plan (Clean-Slate Approach)

| Step | Command / Action | Purpose |
|------|------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Close / delete PR #78** via GitHub UI | Remove circular edge |
| 2 | `git checkout droid/ux-transformation` | Switch to feature branch |
| 3 | `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main` | Replay UX commits atop latest main (includes PR #77) |
| 4 | **Manual conflict fix**<br/>   - `Shell.tsx` – keep MVP keyboard shortcuts & styling from _main_ and sidebar enhancements from UX branch.<br/>   - `investigation.ts` – unify Zustand store; preserve persistence logic from _main_ plus new fields from UX.<br/>   - `useAuth.ts` – retain secure cookie logic from _main_; merge UX provider improvements.<br/>   - `package.json` – deduplicate deps, keep highest semver. | Produce single, coherent versions |
| 5 | `git add … && git rebase --continue` | Finish rebase |
| 6 | `git push --force-with-lease` | Update remote branch |
| 7 | Confirm **PR #76** now shows “_Able to merge_” and pass CI | Validate fix |
| 8 | Merge PR #76 → **main** | Integrate UX work |
| 9 | Delete `droid/ux-transformation` branch locally & on GitHub | House-keeping |

Estimated hands-on time: **25-30 min**.

## 5. Long-Term Preventive Measures

1. **Branch Naming + PR Template Guard**  
   Add a checklist item _“Is base = `main`?”_ to PR template.

2. **Protected Branch Rules**  
   Restrict opening PRs **into** feature branches unless explicitly required.

3. **Automated Conflict Alerts**  
   Enable GitHub Actions job that comments when a PR introduces a reverse-merge edge.

4. **Short-Lived Feature Branches**  
   Rebase frequently (<48 h) or adopt trunk-based development with feature flags.

5. **Pair-merge Ritual**  
   Two-person review for any merge that touches shared core files (`Shell.tsx`, state stores).

## 6. Appendix – Detailed Conflict Notes

### `Shell.tsx`
| Branch | Key Change | Keep? |
|--------|------------|-------|
| `main` | ✔ MVP shortcuts, risk badge colours | ✔ |
| `ux`   | ✔ Collapsible context ribbon, keyboard overlay help | ✔ |

Merge by **composing**: start from `ux` file then splice in shortcut handler block from `main`.

### `investigation.ts`
Combine:
* `main` – persistent storage + riskScore field  
* `ux`   – `chatGraphLinkMode`, `notifications` count

### `useAuth.ts`
* Keep secure **httpOnly cookie refresh** logic (`main`)
* Add UX provider’s **toast + redirect flows**

✅ **After these steps the repository will have a linear history with all UX features and no dangling PRs.**
