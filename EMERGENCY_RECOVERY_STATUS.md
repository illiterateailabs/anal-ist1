# üö® EMERGENCY RECOVERY STATUS  
_Repository:_ **illiterateailabs/androidanalist**

## 1 ‚Ä¢ Incident Summary
At **15:25** we discovered the default branch (`main`) contains **only 5 files** instead of the expected 800 +.  
The following critical directories have disappeared:

| Missing Path | Expected Contents | Impact |
|--------------|------------------|--------|
| `backend/`   | FastAPI services, agents, tools | Application cannot start |
| `frontend/**` (90 % lost) | Next.js pages, components | UI build fails |
| `memory-bank/` | Architecture & status docs | Knowledge base gone |
| `tests/` | 220+ pytest files | CI no longer validates |
| `alembic/` | DB migrations | Deploys blocked |
| Config files (`Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `Makefile`, `*.yml`) | Build & infra scripts | Dev & prod pipelines broken |

The loss coincides with the merge/push of **PR #79** from branch `droid/conflict-resolution`.

---

## 2 ‚Ä¢ Technical Diagnosis
| Evidence | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| `git ls-tree -r HEAD --name-only` returns 5 paths | Objects missing from tree |
| `git log --oneline --decorate -5` shows commit `188147a` (‚Äúüîß Branch Conflict Resolution‚Ä¶‚Äù) replacing tree | Force-push overwrote history |
| `refs/heads/main@{N}` (reflog) contains previous good commit `f221f78`  | Good snapshot exists 2 hours ago |
| GitHub PR diff for #79 shows **file deletions of 700+ files** (mistaken base) | Merge strategy error: feature branch created from shallow file subset |
| Protected-branch rules were not active (force-push allowed) | Governance gap |

Root cause: **mis-based conflict-resolution branch** pushed with `--force-with-lease`, inadvertently deleting untouched paths.

## 3 ‚Ä¢ Immediate Recovery Plan (‚ÄúCook & Push‚Äù)  

| Step | Command / Action | Owner | ETA |
|------|------------------|-------|-----|
| **1** | Create safety tag on current HEAD<br>`git tag emergency-bad-state $(git rev-parse HEAD) && git push origin emergency-bad-state` | Luka | 5 min |
| **2** | Restore last known good tree<br>`git checkout -b restore-20250618 f221f78` | Luka | 5 min |
| **3** | Sanity-test locally (backend `uvicorn`, frontend `npm run build`) | Any dev | 20 min |
| **4** | Fast-forward `main` to good commit **WITHOUT** history rewrite:<br>`git push origin restore-20250618:main` **‚Äìforce-with-lease** | Repo admin | 2 min |
| **5** | Re-open PR #79 against fresh main, but _fix base_ to avoid deletions (or cherry-pick only needed files). | FE lead | 1 h |
| **6** | Enable branch protection: block force-push, require 1 approval & CI green. | Admin | 10 min |
| **7** | Trigger CI and smoke tests; verify docker‚Äêcompose up succeeds. | DevOps | 30 min |

_If reflog becomes unreachable_: use GitHub UI **‚ÄúRevert commit‚Äù** on `188147a` or contact GitHub support (7-day backup available).

---

## 4 ‚Ä¢ Risk & Impact Assessment
| Area | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| Production uptime | **High** (service will not deploy) | Restore tree before next CI run |
| Team velocity | High | Work blocked until files return |
| Data loss | Low ‚Äì objects still in reflog / remote PRs | Act within 30 days to avoid GC |
| Trust / audit | Medium | Document incident (this file), enable protections |

---

## 5 ‚Ä¢ Next Steps After Restoration
1. **Post-mortem meeting** ‚Äì within 24 h.  
2. **Automated diff guard** ‚Äì GitHub Action fails PR if deletion > 20 %.  
3. **Daily off-site mirror** ‚Äì push to `git@backup`.  
4. **Documentation** ‚Äì Reinstate `memory-bank/MASTER_STATUS.md` update cadence.  
5. **Sim API integration** resumes **only after repo is stable** (Balances & Activity ingestion branch to be rebased onto recovered main).
